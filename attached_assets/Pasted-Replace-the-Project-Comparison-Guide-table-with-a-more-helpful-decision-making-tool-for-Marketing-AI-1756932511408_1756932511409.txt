Replace the Project Comparison Guide table with a more helpful decision-making tool for Marketing AI Houston:

**New Table Structure:**

| **Decision Factors** | **Google Business AI Domination** | **AI Marketing System Setup** | **Website + AI Optimization** |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Main Problem Solved** | "Not showing up in local searches" | "Spending too much time on marketing" | "Website not converting visitors" |
| **Monthly Time Savings** | 5-8 hours (posting & reviews) | 10-15 hours (content creation) | 3-5 hours (lead management) |
| **Best If You Currently** | Post inconsistently on Google | Manually create all content | Have outdated/slow website |
| **You'll See Results When** | Customers find you in local search | You automate daily marketing tasks | More website visitors become leads |
| **Typical Client Profile** | Local restaurant, salon, contractor | Professional service, growing business | Any business needing web presence |
| **Investment vs Monthly Agency** | Replaces $300-500/month local SEO | Replaces $800-1500/month content creation | Replaces $1000-2000/month web management |
| **ROI Payback Period** | 2-3 months | 1-2 months | 3-4 months |
| **Perfect If Your Revenue Is** | $10K-50K/month | $25K-100K/month | $50K-200K/month |

**Add Decision Helper Section Below Table:**
"Still not sure? Here's a simple way to choose:
- Choose Google Business AI if you're not showing up when people search for your services locally
- Choose AI Marketing System if you're spending more than 10 hours/week on marketing tasks
- Choose Website + AI if your current website was built more than 3 years ago or converts poorly
- Not sure about your website conversion? We can tell you in 5 minutes during a free consultation"

**Add "What You DON'T Get" Section:**
Make it clear this isn't ongoing management:
- We don't manage your marketing month-to-month
- We don't create new content for you after the project
- We don't run your advertising campaigns
- We BUILD systems that YOU own and control forever

This helps set proper expectations and differentiates from traditional agencies.
